INTRODUCTION

This plugin allows you to use a browser on your PC or your smart phone to upload ebooks into the Home folder of your device with KOReader. The device can be an eReader, a smartphone, PC, etc.). Upload is possible for ebooks with extension types "epub", "pdf", "azw3", "mobi", "docx" and "txt".

Upload happens wirelessly via your home Wifi or via the Hotspot on your phone or via any network as long as the device with the Browser and the device with KOReader can connect to each other over the same LAN. The connection is over HTTP only on the port number set in the plugin. 
The plugin has a function to generate a QRcode for the Login on your smart phone or PC for example. 
An own defined username and password can be set as well. 

The default is Login username is "admin" with password "1234" (without the double quotes!).

Before starting the plugin make sure Wifi is ON and the device with KOreader is connected to your LAN.
That is required in order to obtain an IP address which is used to make a connection from a browser to your device. 

The plugin starts a webserver on the KOReader device at the defined port (default 8080). 
That webserver runs for the number op seconds you have set (default 60 seconds = 1 min maximum 15 min) and stops automatically to save you a battery drain! From version 1.1.5 you can also manually Stop the Upload Server via the Browser. This overrules the runtime. 
The ebooks appear automatically in the folder that you have set as Home folder. 
So that could be any folder that KOReader can access on the device and that provides write access.

BTW: this is not an wireless upload via VPN or a third party... Nobody else is needed or involved. Just you and your LAN. 
If you use the standard available Hotspot function of the smart phone of your friend and you connect your ereader with the KOReader installed to that Hotspot then you have a LAN to work with. Then connect via a browser to the URL shown by the Upload server and you both can exchange ebooks directly via upload/download as you are both on the same LAN.

The browser menu provides various (sorted) folder listings from where you can download ebooks and all other shown files. You can also download all your clipping files that contain the notes you made in your ebooks from the clipboard folder that you have set in KOreader.

See the github folder with the screen prints to get an overview.

This plugin was developed on Ubuntu 24 and works on Ubuntu 24, Raspberry Pi 4 with Bookworm and Samsung/Android Smartphones when KOReader is installed.
It should also work on KOBO and from version 1.1 probably also on Kindle. Note: Kindle has a firewall installed that blocked previous versions of this Plugin. By adding a firewall rule I hope that it will work on Kindle as well. However I am not sure as I cannot test that.


WHAT TO DO IF YOU CANNOT ACCESS FROM A BROWSER THE UPLOAD SERVER? 

Check the following points:
1. Is Wifi ON? -> Switch on Wifi
2. Is device connected to the LAN? -> Login to your LAN with the KOReader device as an IP is required. Check IP
3. Is Plugin Settings menu function NOT showing your LAN IP but just 127.0.0.1? -> Use Plugin menu Reset function, Restart KOReader or the device when needed and check Steps 1 and 2 after a restart!
4. Is the Upload Server running? -> Your Menu should be blocked else (re-)start the Upload Server
5. Is your browser showing "Unable to connect" -> Check if the Upload server is still running (see point 4) as the runtime might be over (automatic stop is activated)!
6. You still connect connect after checking above points? -> Is there a firewall blocking the connection? That firewall can be running on your router, your Browser device and/or your KOReader device. The port you have set may not be blocked by the firewall. Maybe some ereader devices with build-in firewall do not allow you to connect to your LAN. If the latter is the case you might be stuck. See the note about Kindle firewall before.
7. Has the plugin crashed? -> You might Restart after a Reset


INSTALLATION
1. Connect via USB cable your KOReader device with a PC or equal device.

2. Locate the folder where KOReader is installed, e.g. on Kobo: /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/ 
The plugins directory will be: /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins

3. Create in the plugins directory a sub directory called MyUpload.koplugin 
Like this: /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/MyUpload.koplugin

4. Now unzip MyUpload.koplugin.zip and copy following two files into 
   the new sub directory called /mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/MyUpload.koplugin
   These two files are:
   _meta.lua 
   main.lua 

5. Check if these two files are in that Folder. No other files are required and no other sub-directories as well.

6. Installation is done. 

7. Now start KOReader and the Plugin Upload Server for the First time, check the IP address and hereafter you MUST RESTART KOReader AGAIN so that the new settings are activated!

UPDATE NOTES

version: 1.0.1
- first release

version: 1.0.2
- Removed the space in the URL generated with plugin function QRCode. Now corrected.

version: 1.1
- Always an Error page was shown when downloading a clipping file. The wrong directory path was set. Now corrected.
- Added Firewall rule for Kindle device which is a copy of the rules as set in the standard HTTP Inspector plugin of KOReader.
- Expanded the README.md file with Installation process and a Checklist for problem solving

version: 1.1.1
- Download of a clipping file failed and Plugin crashed when the user has no "Notes and Highlights Export folder" set. 
  This is now checked and a message will be shown when using function: List Clipboard folder
- When the user has no Home folder set the "run time folder" marked with a "." is set 
  This is now checked and a message will be shown when using function: List Home folder
- Improved handling of IP address and Nil folder values. You cannot override the IP address

version: 1.1.2
- List eBooks in Folders (sub function List) showed ebooks in that subfolder. The download URL was wrong. Now corrected

version: 1.1.3
- When a user had accessed the Upload Server succesfully then closed its browser(tab) and lateron restarted with the same browser the (new) session again by entering the URL of the Upload Server and directly submitted a request then it is possible that the browser is sending an EMPTY request. Those empty request where send to and received by the Upload Server plugin leading to a crash of KOReader. When now empty requests are detected the plugin skips them and continues with next request. 

version: 1.1.4
- Upload of .gz file caused KOReader to crash. Now uploads of .gz, .zip and .tar files are rejected by the Upload form
- Multiple file upload was possible, but for each file a response form was generated and the returned page looked somewhat strange
  Now the upload response page is formatted shows all results in a table.
  IMPORTANT: limit the number of files in one go as you might crash your KOReader due to memory overflows.
  Do not go beyond the capabilities of your device. As a rule of tumb upload maximum 5 files/eBooks at a time.
  
version: 1.1.5
- New function added to Stop the Upload server via the browser. You can overrule the automatically set runtime with this. It unlocks the menu and you can continue immediately with the KOReader.
- Update Home page and Menu bar with the new Stop function
- New are the Page function to scroll through the books instead of a long List view. A browser (the most) that supports javascript is needed. 
  Note: The very limited beta-browser on Kobo is not suitable to work with this Plugin. You can login and list, but download and other functions will not work properly i have noticed.
- New screen prints of the added functions
  
version: 1.1.6
- Support for .cbz files has been added  
- Download to Android with Firefox has now the name of the eBook in stead of default "download.bin"  
- README.md text updated to correct the Hotspot LAN scenario. 

version 1.1.7
- Move of the menu entry NEW: Upload Server under Clogs icon, Upload Server. The word NEW is now dropped.
